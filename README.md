## Original Prompt

Create an application for an ice cream flavor which serves different flavors of ice cream. Customers can enhance their ice creams through a number of toppings, like sprinkles, whipped cream, sauces, fruits, wafers, and many more! Ice-creams are served in single or double scoops either in a cup (small, medium, large) or in a cone. The total cost of the order is calculated based on the floor, size, and toppings. Create a command-line interactive application that takes in user input for flavor, serving size, cup/cone, and toppings, and prints the cost of their order. You are required to use the Decorator Pattern for this problem.
